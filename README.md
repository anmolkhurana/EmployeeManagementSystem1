EmployeeManagementSystem

Introduction
I have used HTML,JSP and Java to create this webpage. This webpage gives the basic idea of the operations that can be performed usinf JSP.
I have used JDBC concepts in collaboration with the JSP and HTML. For the basic understanding I have imported java code in the 
JSP making it a front-end designing and coding website. 

Features
This project will demonstrate how one can switch from one page to another using JSP while establishing a connection to the database. I have used CSS file to bring in the 
style of the website. Apachey tomcat 8.5 is used with latest version of Eclipse Oxygen.

Why?
When it comes to the website development one should start with HTML , CSS and JDBC (Depending upon the choice of the developer). 
For me, this project made everything clear. There are various tutorials on the internet which will help you understand these concepts.
JDBC is another important concept that one must understand.
